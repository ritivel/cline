MODULE  2 : COMMON TECHNICAL DOCUMENT SUMMARIES
2.3 : QUALITY OVERALL SUMMARY (QOS)

The Quality Overall Summary (QOS) is a summary that follows the scope and the outline of
the Body of Data in Module 3. The QOS should not include information, data or justification
that was not already included in Module 3 or in other parts of the CTD.
The QOS should include sufficient information from each section to provide the Quality
reviewer with an overview of Module 3. The QOS should also emphasise critical key
parameters of the product and provide, for instance, justification in cases where guidelines
were not followed. The QOS should include a discussion of key issues that integrates
information from sections in the Quality Module and supporting information from other
Modules (e.g. qualification of impurities via toxicological studies discussed under the CTD-S
module), including cross-referencing to volume and page number in other Modules.
This QOS normally should not exceed 40 pages of text, excluding tables and figures. For
biotech products and products manufactured using more complex processes, the document
could be longer but normally should not exceed 80 pages of text (excluding tables and
figures).
The italicised text below indicates where tables, figures, or other items can be imported
directly from Module 3.

	summarise the impurity levels in batches of the drug substance used in the non-clinical
	studies, in the clinical trials, and in typical batches manufactured by the proposed
	commercial process. The QOS should state how the proposed impurity limits are
