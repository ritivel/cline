2.7.4.4 Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety
The manner of presenting cross-study observations and comparisons of vital signs (e.g., heart
rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate), weight and other data (e.g.,
electrocardiograms, X-rays) related to safety should be similar to that for laboratory variables.
If there is evidence of a drug effect, any dose-response or drug concentration-response
relationship or relationship to individual variables (e.g., disease, demographics, concomitant
therapy) should be identified and the clinical relevance of the observation described.
Particular attention should be given to changes not evaluated as efficacy variables and to those
considered to be adverse events. Particular attention should be given to studies that were
designed to evaluate specific safety issues, e.g., studies of QT interval prolongation
