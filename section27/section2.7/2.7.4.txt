2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety
This section should be a summary of data relevant to safety in the intended patient population,
integrating the results of individual clinical study reports as well as other relevant reports, e.g.,
the integrated analyses of safety that are routinely submitted in some regions.
The display of safety-related data can be considered at three levels (ICH E3):
– The extent of exposure (dose, duration, number of patients, type of patients) should be
examined to determine the degree to which safety can be assessed from the database.
– The more common adverse events and changes in laboratory tests should be identified and
classified, and their occurrence should be summarised.
– Serious adverse events (defined in ICH E2A) and other significant adverse events (defined
in ICH E3) should be identified and their occurrence should be summarised. These events
should be examined for frequency over time, particularly for drugs that may be used
chronically.
The safety profile of the drug, described on the basis of analysis of all clinical safety data,
should be outlined in a detailed, clear, and objective manner, with use of tables and figures.
