2.7.1.4 Appendix
Tables and figures should be embedded in the text of the appropriate sections when they
enhance the readability of the document. Lengthy tables can be provided in the appendix at
the end of the Section.
Tables 2.7.1.1 and 2.7.1.2 are provided as examples of tabular formats for reporting
information and results related to bioavailability and in vitro dissolution studies respectively.
These examples give results as well as identifying the type and design of the study. Tables
prepared for reporting the results of BE studies could also include the mean ratios
(test/reference) for Cmax and AUC and their 90% confidence interval, or the currently
recommended metrics for BE assessments.
These tables are not intended to be templates, but only to illustrate the type of information that
should be considered by an applicant in designing the tables for biopharmaceutic studies.
Applicants should also decide whether information and results from these studies are best
presented in tables, text or figures in order to aid clarity. If, for example, results are best
presented in text and figures, tables might be used simply to list the studies.
