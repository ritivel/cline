2.7.3.6 Appendix
Tables and figures should be embedded in the text of the appropriate sections when that
enhances the readability of the document. Lengthy tables can be provided in the appendix at
the end of the Section.
Tables should identify all studies pertinent to the evaluation of efficacy (including studies that
were terminated or are not yet completed, studies that failed to show effectiveness for any
reason, studies available only as publications, studies reported in full technical reports (ICH
E3), and studies described in abbreviated reports); and should provide the most important
results of those studies. Note, however, that unplanned interim analyses on ongoing studies
are generally not needed or encouraged. When more than one section 2.7.3 is provided for an
application with more than one indication, usually each section should have its own appendix
with tables.
Illustrative tables for an antihypertensive drug are provided, but these examples will not be
relevant to every application. In general, applications will require tables and/or figures that
are developed specifically for the particular drug class and the studies that were carried out.
