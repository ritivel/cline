2.7.3.1 Background and Overview of Clinical Efficacy
This section should describe the program of controlled studies and other pertinent studies in
the application that evaluated efficacy specific to the indication(s) sought. Any results of these
studies that are pertinent to evaluation of safety should be discussed in Section 2.7.4,
Summary of Clinical Safety.
The section should begin with a brief overview of the design of the controlled studies that
were conducted to evaluate efficacy. These studies include dose-response, comparative
efficacy, long-term efficacy, and efficacy studies in population subsets. Critical features of
study design should be discussed, e.g., randomisation, blinding, choices of control treatment,
choice of patient population, unusual design features such as crossover or randomised
withdrawal designs, use of run-in periods, other methods of "enrichment", study endpoints,
study duration, and prespecified plans for analysis of the study results. Although this section is
intended to focus on clinical investigations, nonclinical data and clinical pharmacology data
may also be referenced as appropriate to provide a comprehensive summary of human
experience related to efficacy. This section should not include detailed information about
individual studies.
