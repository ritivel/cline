2.7.4.7 Appendix
Tabular presentations should be provided that summarise the important results from all studies
pertinent to the evaluation of safety and particularly to support product labelling.
Tables and figures should be embedded in the text of the appropriate sections when that
enhances the readability of the document. Lengthy tables can be provided in the appendix at
the end of the Section.
A few illustrative tables are provided, but a clinical summary will routinely need tables and
figures that have been developed for the particular drug, drug class, and clinical indication(s).
See sections 2.7.4.2.1, 2.7.4.2.2.3, and 2.7.4.3 of this guidance for additional discussion
regarding the content of section 2.7.4 tables.
