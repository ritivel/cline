2.7.3.5 Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects
Available information on persistence of efficacy over time should be summarised. The
number of patients for whom long-term efficacy data are available, and the length of
exposure, should be provided. Any evidence of tolerance (loss of therapeutic effects over
time) should be noted. Examination of any apparent relationships between dose changes over
time and long-term efficacy may be useful.
The primary focus should be on controlled studies specifically designed to collect long-term
efficacy data, and such studies should be clearly differentiated from other, less rigorous, 
studies such as open extension studies. This distinction also applies to specific studies
designed for evaluation of tolerance and withdrawal effects. Data concerning withdrawal or
rebound effects pertinent to product safety should be presented in the safety section (see
section 2.7.4).
In long-term efficacy trials, the effect of premature discontinuation of therapy or switching to
other therapies upon the assessment of the results should be considered. These issues might
also be important for short term trials and should be addressed when discussing the results of
these trials, if appropriate.
