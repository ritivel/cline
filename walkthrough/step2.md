# Deep Document Intelligence

**Ritivel starts with broad context and explores deeply where needed.**

Ritivel is designed with inherent document intelligence. It doesn't operate in a vacuum, but starts with a structural understanding of your regulatory project. Before making changes, it performs targeted agentic exploration to gain any additional specific context required, ensuring its actions are always well-informed and aligned with your regulatory requirements.
