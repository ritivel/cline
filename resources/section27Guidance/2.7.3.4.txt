2.7.3.4 Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations
This section should provide an integrated summary and analysis of all data that pertain to the
dose-response or blood level-response relationships of effectiveness (including dose-blood
level relationships), and thus have contributed to dose selection and choice of dose interval.
Relevant data from nonclinical studies may be referenced, and relevant data from
pharmacokinetic studies, other clinical pharmacology studies, and controlled and uncontrolled
clinical studies should be summarised to illustrate these dose-response or blood level-response
relationships. For pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies from which data have been
summarised in Section 2.7.2.2, it may be appropriate to draw upon those data in this summary
while cross-referencing the summaries in Section 2.7.2.2, without repeating those summaries.
While the interpretation of how these data support specific dosing recommendations should be
supplied in the Clinical Overview document, the individual study results and any cross-study
analyses that will be used to support the dosing recommendations (including the
recommended starting and maximal doses, the method of dose titration, and any other
instructions regarding individualisation of dosage) should be summarised here. Any identified
deviations from relatively simple dose-response or blood-level response relationships due to
non-linearity of pharmacokinetics, delayed effects, tolerance, enzyme induction, etc. should be
described.
Any evidence of differences in dose-response relationships that result from a patient's age,
sex, race, disease, or other factors should be described. Any evidence of different
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic responses should also be discussed, or discussions in
Section 2.7.2 can be cross-referenced. The ways in which such differences were looked for,
even if no differences were found, should be described (e.g., specific studies in
subpopulations, analysis of efficacy results by subgroup, or blood level determinations of the
test drug).
