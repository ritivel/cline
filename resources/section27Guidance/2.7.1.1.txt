2.7.1 Summary of Biopharmaceutic Studies and Associated Analytical Methods
2.7.1.1 Background and Overview
This section should provide the reviewer with an overall view of the formulation development
process, the in vitro and in vivo dosage form performance, and the general approach and
rationale used in developing the bioavailability (BA), comparative BA, bioequivalence (BE),
and in vitro dissolution profile database. Reference should be made to any guidelines or
literature used in planning and conducting the studies. This section should also provide the
reviewer with an overview of the analytical methods used, with emphasis on the performance
characteristics of assay validation (e.g., linearity range, sensitivity, specificity) and quality
control (e.g., accuracy and precision). This section should not include detailed information
about individual studies.
