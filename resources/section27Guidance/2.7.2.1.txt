2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies
2.7.2.1 Background and Overview
This section should provide the reviewer with an overall view of the clinical pharmacology
studies. These studies include clinical studies performed to evaluate human pharmacokinetics
(PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD), and in vitro studies performed with human cells, tissues,
or related materials (hereinafter referred to as human biomaterials) that are pertinent to PK
processes. For vaccine products, this section should provide the reviewer with immune
response data that support the selection of dose, dosage schedule, and formulation of the final
product. Where appropriate, relevant data that are summarised in sections 2.7.1, 2.7.3 and
2.7.4 can also be referenced to provide a comprehensive view of the approach and rationale
for the development of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, PK/PD and human
biomaterial database. This section should not include detailed information about individual
studies.
This section should begin with a brief overview of the human biomaterial studies that were
conducted and that were intended to help in the interpretation of PK or PD data. Studies of
permeability (e.g., intestinal absorption, blood brain barrier passage), protein binding, hepatic
metabolism, and metabolic-based drug-drug interactions are particularly relevant. This should
be followed by a brief overview of the clinical studies that were carried out to characterise PK
and PD of the medicinal product, including studies of PK/PD relationships in healthy subjects
and patients, and relevant effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on PK and PK/PD
relationships4
. Critical aspects of study design and data analysis should be noted, e.g., the
choice of the single or multiple doses used, the study population, choice of the intrinsic or
extrinsic factors that were studied, the choice of PD endpoints, and whether a traditional
approach or a population approach was used to collect and analyse data to assess PK or PD.
