2.7.2.2 Summary of Results of Individual Studies
A tabular listing of all clinical pharmacology studies should generally be provided (see 2.7.2.5
Appendix), together with a narrative description of the relevant features and outcomes of each
of the critical individual studies that provided in vitro or in vivo data and information relevant
to PK, PD and PK/PD relationships. The narrative descriptions should be brief, e.g., similar to
an abstract for a journal article, and should describe critical design features and critical results.
Similar studies may be described together, noting the individual study results and any
important differences among the studies. References or electronic links to the full report of
each study should be included in the narratives.
Summaries of dose-response or concentration response (PK/PD) studies with
pharmacodynamic endpoints should generally be included in this section. In some cases,
however, when well-controlled dose-response PD or PK/PD studies provide important
evidence of efficacy or safety, they should be placed in 2.7.3 or 2.7.4 as appropriate and
referenced, but not summarised, here.
