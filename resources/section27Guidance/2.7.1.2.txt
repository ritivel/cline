2.7.1.2 Summary of Results of Individual Studies
A tabular listing of all biopharmaceutic studies should generally be provided (see 2.7.1.4
Appendix), together with narrative descriptions of relevant features and outcomes of each of
the individual studies that provided important in vitro or in vivo data and information relevant
to BA and BE. The narrative descriptions should be brief, e.g., similar to an abstract for a
journal article, and should describe critical design features and critical results. Similar studies
may be described together, noting the individual study results and any important differences
among the studies. These narratives may be abstracted from the ICH E3 synopsis. References
or electronic links to the full report of each study should be included in the narratives
