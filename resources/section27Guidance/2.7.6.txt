2.7.6 Synopses of Individual Studies
The ICH E3 guideline (Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports) suggests inclusion of
a study synopsis with each clinical study report, and provides one example of a format for
such synopses.
This section should include the table entitled Listing of Clinical Studies, described in
guidance for Module 5, followed by all individual study synopses organised in the same
sequence as the study reports in Module 5.
It is expected that one synopsis will be prepared per study for use in all regions, and that the
same synopsis will be included in this section and as part of the clinical study report in
Module 5. The length of a synopsis will usually be up to 3 pages, but a synopsis for a more
complex and important study may be longer, e.g. 10 pages. Within the individual synopsis,
tables and figures should be used as appropriate to aid clarity.
