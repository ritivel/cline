The Clinical Summary is intended to provide a detailed, factual summarisation of all of the
clinical information in the Common Technical Document. This includes information
provided in ICH E3 clinical study reports; information obtained from any meta-analyses or
other cross-study analyses for which full reports have been included in Module 5; and postmarketing data for products that have been marketed in other regions. The comparisons and
analyses of results across studies provided in this document should focus on factual
observations. In contrast, the CTD Clinical Overview document should provide critical
analysis of the clinical study program and its results, including discussion and interpretation of
the clinical findings and discussion of the place of the test drug in the armamentarium.
The length of the Clinical Summary will vary substantially according to the information to be
conveyed, but it is anticipated that (excluding attached tables) the Clinical Summary will
usually be in the range of 50 to 400 pages.
