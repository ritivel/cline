2.7.3.2 Summary of Results of Individual Studies
A tabular listing of all studies that provided (or were designed to provide) information
relevant to product efficacy should generally be provided (see the section 2.7.3.6 Appendix), 
together with narrative descriptions for important studies. The narrative descriptions should be
brief, e.g., similar to an abstract for a journal article, and should describe critical design
features and critical results. Similar studies may be described together, noting the individual
study results and any important differences among the studies. For studies that also
contributed significantly to the safety analysis, study narratives should include information
about the extent of exposure of study subjects to the test drug or control agent, and how safety
data were collected. These narratives can be abstracted from the synopses of the clinical
study reports (ICH E3). References or electronic links to the full report of each study should
be included in the narratives.
Narratives of any bridging studies using clinical endpoints, i.e., certain studies intended to
evaluate the ability to extrapolate certain types of foreign clinical data to the new region (see
ICH E5), should be included in this section. An analysis of the results of such studies, together
with other information (e.g., PK and PD data) that addresses the ability to extrapolate the
efficacy and safety results of foreign studies, should be performed if necessary. The
conclusions of such an analysis should be noted at the start of Section 2.7.3.3.2, Comparison
of Efficacy Results of All Studies, and the full report of the analysis should be provided in
Module 5.
